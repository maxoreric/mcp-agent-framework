# MCP Agent Framework Development Log

## Sprint 1: Project Setup and Core Agent Implementation

### Day 1 - Project Initialization

**Date:** 2025-03-16

**Goals:**
- Set up project structure
- Create core Agent class implementation
- Implement basic MCP integration

**Progress:**
1. Created project directory structure
2. Set up README with basic documentation
3. Created development log to track progress
4. Started implementing the core Agent class using FastMCP
5. Added detailed comments for all code components

**Decisions:**
- Using FastMCP for agent implementation to leverage the simplified API
- Implementing both sync and async methods for flexibility
- Using XML-style tags for structured communication between agents

**Next Steps:**
- Complete the Agent class implementation
- Implement Agent Hierarchy management
- Create basic task orchestration

**Blockers:**
- None at this time

### Day 2 - Agent Implementation

**Date:** 2025-03-16

**Goals:**
- Complete Agent class implementation
- Implement Agent Hierarchy
- Implement Agent Factory
- Set up task orchestration

**Progress:**
1. Completed core Agent class implementation with MCP capabilities
2. Implemented AgentHierarchy class for managing agent relationships
3. Created AgentFactory for dynamic agent creation
4. Implemented basic task orchestration with decomposition
5. Added task dependency handling
6. Implemented task execution
7. Added LLM integration for OpenAI and Anthropic APIs
8. Created prompt management system
9. Implemented CLI interface with Rich library
10. Added visualization components for tasks and agents
11. Created main framework class
12. Added example implementations (coding_assistant, research_assistant)

**Decisions:**
- Using task ID-based tracking for task management
- Implementing a tree-based task dependency system
- Using dynamic agent creation for specialized tasks
- Including both OpenAI and Anthropic API support
- Using Rich library for CLI interface to provide a better user experience

**Next Steps:**
- Add testing infrastructure
- Implement additional examples
- Add support for local file operations
- Enhance error handling and recovery
- Add advanced visualization for task progress

**Blockers:**
- None at this time
